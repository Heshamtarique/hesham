### Projects
* Multi Class Arrhythmia Detection using Convolution Transformer based model
  Using the MIT-BIH-Arrhythmia Database and the PTB-diagnosis database, this project involved leveraging advanced deep-learning techniques to detect     cardiac arrhythmias from ECG signal data, intending to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in five classes. The model that outperformed   the other one was the Convolution-Transformer-based model which gives an accuracy of 0.9824 and recall of 0.98.

  
* Violence detection from real life videos using Vision Transformer
  The main objective of the work is to propose a real-time violence event identifier based on state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Primarily the      proposed model is based on the ViT (Vision Transformer) architecture, while other models like ConvLSTM and VGG16 with LSTM were also explored in       this work. Two benchmark datasets viz. the RLVS (Real Life Violence Situations) and the Hockey Fight datasets were used in this work for robust        training and test analysis of the proposed model. For evaluating the modelâ€™s performance various metrics including accuracy, f1-score, precision,      and recall were evaluated. The results show that the Vision Transformer-based model outperformed all the explored models with an overall accuracy of   98% and 97% on the RLVS dataset and the Hockey datasets respectively, which are also significantly higher than the recent solutions proposed on        these datasets.

* CiC: Conceptual Image Captioning
  The goal of this project is to develop a model that can automatically understand the visual content of images and describe it in natural             language(Dataset: XM3600 by Google). Two experiments have been performed using the CNN+LSTM-based model and ViT+GPT2-based model by OpenAI. We are   working on improving the accuracy of the model.
  
* Chromosome Segmentation and Classification
